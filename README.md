# SpringBoot
Spring Boot helps you to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need.

You can use Spring Boot to create stand-alone Java applications that can be started using java -jar or more traditional WAR deployments. We also provide a command line tool that runs Spring scripts.

Our primary goals are:

Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all Spring development.

Be opinionated, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.

Provide a range of non-functional features common to large classes of projects (for example, embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration).

Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.
